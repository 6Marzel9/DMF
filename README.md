# DMF Swap App

The DMF Swap App redefines token ecosystems and referral programs by prioritizing transparency, fair value distribution, and sustainable growth. Unlike traditional swap apps or referral programs, DMF tokens provide clear utility and are backed by a growing treasury. The app facilitates effortless token swaps and encourages community involvement through its referral system. By holding DMF tokens, users can earn Organization Perks across eight levels, ensuring a fair and rewarding experience for all participants.

## Core Objectives

* <strong>Seamless Swaps:</strong> Users can easily swap DMF tokens for XLM or other Stellar tokens, contributing to the growth and stability of the DMF ecosystem with every transaction.

* <strong>Real-Time Updates and Account Tracking:</strong> The app provides real-time tracking of all transactions, with detailed visibility into swap operations.

* <strong>Blockchain Verification:</strong> Every transaction and operation are fully transparent and verifiable on the Stellar blockchain.

* <strong>Fair and Minimal Fees:</strong> Fees collected from swaps contribute to referral allocations and Treasury growth while maintaining minimal user costs.

* <strong>Value Stability</strong>: Automated supply management and integration with the Treasury ensure DMF token stability over time.
